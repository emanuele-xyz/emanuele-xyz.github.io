        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of this work is to to present to the uninitiated what a BRDF is. We follow by
            discussing the most notorious BRDFs in the literature. Each BRDF is also implemented using a graphics API.

    <section id="rendering-equation">
        <h2>The Rendering Equation</h2>
        <p>
            Before focusing on BRDFs, we need to take a step back and spend some time talking about the
            rendering equation. We do this because BRDFs are just one piece of the puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rendering equation, as was introduced by Kajiya in 1986 <a href="#[1]">[1]</a>, is presented below.
        </p>
        <div style="overflow: auto;">
            $$ I(x, x') = g(x, x') \left[ \epsilon(x, x') + \int_S \rho(x, x', x'') I(x', x'') \, dx'' \right] $$
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>\( I(x, x') \) is the light going from point \(x'\) to point \(x\).</li>
            <li>\( g(x, x') \) is a geometry term. This term represents occlusion.</li>
            <li>\( g(x, x') = 0 \) when points \(x\) and \(x'\) are not mutually visible. </li>
            <li>\( g(x, x') = \frac{1}{r^2} \) when points \(x\) and \(x'\) are mutually visible.</li>
            <li>\(r\) is the distance between points \(x\) and \(x'\).</li>
            <li>\( \epsilon(x, x') \) is the emitted light going from point \(x'\) to point \(x\).</li>
            <li>\(S\) is the set of all surface points in the scene.</li>
            <li>\( x, x', x'' \in S \) are surface points.</li>
            <li>\( \rho(x, x', x'') \) is the light reflected from point \(x''\) to point \(x\) by point \(x'\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This equation states that the light going from \(x'\) to \(x\) is the sum of the emitted
            light from \(x'\) to \(x\) and the total light that is reflected toward \(x\), by \(x'\), from all other
            surface points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another form for the rendering equation, and the one that you will most probably find in the literature, is
            the following.
        </p>
        <div style="overflow: auto;">
            $$ L_o(x, \omega_o) = L_e(x, \omega_o) + \int_{\Omega} f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o) \, L_i(x, \omega_i) \,
            (\omega_i \cdot n) \, \mathrm{d}\omega_i $$
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                \(L_o(x, \omega_o)\) is the outgoing light, from point \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\).
            </li>
            <li>
                \(L_e(x, \omega_o)\) is the emitted light, from point \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\).
            </li>
            <li>\(\Omega\) is the unit hemisphere centered along \(n\).</li>
            <li>\(n\) is the surface normal at point \(x\).</li>
            <li>\(\omega_i \in \Omega\) is a negated direction for possible incoming light.</li>
            <li>
                \(f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o)\) is the proportion of light, reflected from \(\omega_i\) toward
                \(\omega_o\), at position \(x\).
            </li>
            <li>
                \(L_i(x, \omega_i)\) is the incoming light, toward point \(x\), from direction \(\omega_i\).
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\omega_i \cdot n\) is the cosine of the angle between \(\omega_i\) and \(n\). It is
                used as a weighting term and represents the fact that the intensity of reflected light from a surface is
                proportional to the cosine of the angle between the negated light direction and the surface normal. This
                is Lambert's cosine law. TODO: rephrase this.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This form of the rendering equation follows the same idea as the one above. It states that the
            amount of light going out of point \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\), is the sum of the light emitted by
            \(x\), along \(\omega_o\), and the reflected light at \(x\), along \(\omega_o\).
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            The rendering equation is what unifies all various rendering algorithms. As you may guess, light is a
            central aspect of rendering, especially if we want it to be believable, plausible, or even
            physically accurate. Any non trivial rendering algorithm is, in some way, trying to simulate how light
            works, how light behaves and interacts with matter. This means that any rendering algorithm is trying to
            solve the rendering equation. More precisely, it is trying to find a solution to the rendering equation.
            Solution that, in most cases, either cannot be found, because it doesn't exist, or it would be too complex
            to do so. Thus, what rendering algorithms find when trying to solve the rendering equation is just an
            approximate solution. One that, nonetheless, yields satisfying results.

    <section id="brdf">
        <h2>BRDF</h2>
        <p>
            Looking at the rendering equation, we have already met the idea of a function that tells us how light,
            hitting a surface point, gets reflected off of it. This function is called a bidirectional reflectance
            distribution function, or BRDF for short.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first form of the rendering equation, the BRDF is
            represented by function \( \rho(x, x', x'') \). In the second form of the rendering equation, the BRDF was
            denoted by function \(f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o)\). Throughout the rest of our discussion, we will denote a
            generic BRDF using the latter notation.
        </p>

        <section id="brdf-definition">
            <h3>Definition</h3>

            <p>
                The idea of a BRDF was first presented by Nicodemus, in 1965 <a href="#[2]">[2]</a>. A BRDF \(f_r(x,
                \omega_i, \omega_o)\) is formally defined as the ratio of the reflected radiance, along direction
                \(\omega_o\), to the incoming irradiance, coming from direction \(\omega_i\), both incident on surface
                point \(x\).
            </p>
            <p>
                For simplicity's sake, being less formal but hopefully more clear, we can imagine a BRDF to be
                defined as the ratio of outgoing and incoming light, the first along direction \(\omega_o\), the second
                along direction \(\omega_i\), both being incident at surface point \(x\).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="brdf-materials">
            <h3>Materials</h3>

            <p>
                A BRDF tells us how light gets reflected off a surface. The way in which light interacts with a surface,
                in particular how incident light gets reflected off a surface, entirely depends on the surface's
                characteristics, that is the surface's material. Surfaces with very different materials, interact with
                light in very different ways. Think, for example, of how wood and metal differently reflect light.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is clear that, BRDFs are tightly related to surface materials. In particular, since different
                materials reflect light in different ways, we need to change how a BRDF behaves, depending on the
                surface material. There are two ways in which we can do so:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    We may add additional parameters to our BRDF implementation, apart from \(x\), \(\omega_i\) and
                    \(\omega_o\). For different values of these additional parameters, our BRDF implementation will
                    behave differently. This allows us to model different materials. Changing the values
                    of the additional parameters will yield a different material.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We may use entirely different BRDF implementations for different materials.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Note that, in practice, most people make use of a hybrid approach. In order to model all the materials
                needed to render a scene, different BRDF implementations are used, each one having additional
                parameters. This is because, most BRDF implementations, specialize on a specific set of materials
                that they manage to model with satisfying results.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="brdf-implementation">
            <h3>Implementation</h3>

            <p>
                Above we have mentioned the idea of BRDF implementations. We have yet to see how a BRDF is implemented.
                As Ward <a href="#[4]">[4]</a> puts it, there are two approaches: the empirical approach and the
                theoretical approach.
            </p>

            <section id="brdf-implementation-empirical">
                <h4>Empirical Models</h4>

                <p>
                    An empirical model for a BRDF is just a formula, with additional parameters, used for tweaking it.
                    The main characteristic of an empirical model is that it is not derived following the laws of
                    physics. The author just noticed something about how a given material, or class of materials,
                    interacted with light, and from that observation came up with a formula for the BRDF. From this, we
                    can surely understand that the additional parameters exposed by an empirical model are not of any
                    physical significance.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="brdf-implementation-theoretical">
                <h4>Theoretical Models</h4>

                <p>
                    A theoretical model for a BRDF is an attempt at approximating the real BRDF of a material, or class
                    of materials. This approximation is derived leveraging the laws of physics that we know. The
                    additional parameters exposed by a theoretical model have some physical significance behind them.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="brdf-implementation-measuring">
                <h4>Measuring BRDFs</h4>

                <p>
                    Earlier we said that a BRDF implementation is just an attempt at approximating a real world BRDF.
                    The simplest way in which we can approximate a function is sampling it and finding an approximating
                    function for the samples. Well, it turns out that we can sample a BRDF. We just need a
                    gonioreflectometer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The idea of sampling a BRDF is very simple, but it's not easy to put it into practice. Measuring a
                    BRDF using a gonioreflectometer is a laborious and expensive process. Moreover, we go through a
                    lot of work just to sample a single BRDF. If we were to need more
                    materials for a scene, this approach would not scale. Nonetheless, sampling a BRDF has its uses,
                    both for validating and for coming up with various BRDF implementations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can use the BRDF samples we got from the gonioreflectometer to check whether they match the
                    output of our BRDF implementation. If we have a BRDF implementation with additional parameters, we
                    can check whether or not there is a set of said parameters that yields as output the same value as
                    the sample. If this isn't the case, we know our BRDF implementation cannot model the sampled
                    material.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We can also use the BRDF samples we got from the gonioreflectometer to come up with a new BRDF
                    implementation. This is done by analyzing patterns present in the samples to come up with a new
                    model.

        <section id="brdf-physical-plausibility">
            <h3>Physical Plausibility</h3>

            <p>
                Suppose we came up with our own BRDF model. We would like to know whether or not our model is physically
                plausible, i.e. respect the laws of physics. We know that we can use a gonioreflectometer to sample a
                BRDF and use the samples to validate our model. If the results coming from the model and the samples
                don't match, we know that the model is not physically plausible. In the case of a model with additional
                parameters, if the model and the samples were to match, we would still know nothing about its
                correctness. We would need to sample a lot BRDFs and this wouldn't be realistic. Is there a more general
                rule that can help us understand whether or not our model is physically plausible? It turns out that,
                any physically plausible BRDF implementation must satisfy the following three properties: positivity,
                Helmholtz reciprocity and energy conservation <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>.
            </p>

            <section id="brdf-physical-plausibility-positivity">

                <p>
                    The BRDF implementation must always be positive. Negative reflectance is not allowed.

                <p>
                    The BRDF implementation must follow Helmholtz reciprocity principle. This means that, if we were to swap the
                    incoming and outgoing directions, the reflectance would be the same.

                    destroyed. This means that the amount of outgoing light cannot be greater than the amount of incoming light.
