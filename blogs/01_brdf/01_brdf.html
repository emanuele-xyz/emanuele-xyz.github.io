        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The main idea of this work is to present and implement as many BRDFs as I can. It's a work
            in progress, so expect to find new content the next time you visit.

        <h2>The rendering equation</h2>
        <p>
            Before discussing various BRDFs, it is important to understand what actually is a BRDF. To do this we need
            to
            start by looking at the rendering equation <a href="#[1]">[1]</a>, presented by Kajiya in 1986.
        </p>
        <div style="overflow: auto;">
            $$ I(x, x') = g(x, x') \left[ \epsilon(x, x') + \int_S \rho(x, x', x'') I(x', x'') \, dx'' \right] $$
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>\( I(x, x') \) is the light going from point \(x'\) to point \(x\).</li>
            <li>\( g(x, x') \) is a geometry term. This term represents occlusion.</li>
            <li>\( g(x, x') = 0 \) when points \(x\) and \(x'\) are not mutually visible. </li>
            <li>\( g(x, x') = \frac{1}{r^2} \) when points \(x\) and \(x'\) are mutually visible.</li>
            <li>\(r\) is the distance between points \(x\) and \(x'\).</li>
            <li>\( \epsilon(x, x') \) is the emitted light going from point \(x'\) to point \(x\).</li>
            <li>\(S\) is the set of all surface points in the scene.</li>
            <li>\( x, x', x'' \in S \) are surface points.</li>
            <li>\( \rho(x, x', x'') \) is the light reflected from point \(x''\) to point \(x\) by point \(x'\).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To put it simply, this equation states that the light going from \(x'\) to \(x\) is the sum of the emitted
            light from \(x'\) to \(x\) and the total light that is reflected toward \(x\), by \(x'\), from all other
            surface points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another form for the rendering equation, and the one that you will most probably find when looking around,
            is the following.
        </p>
        <div style="overflow: auto;">
            $$ L_o(x, \omega_o) = L_e(x, \omega_o) + \int_{\Omega} f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o) \, L_i(x, \omega_i) \,
            (\omega_i \cdot n) \, \mathrm{d}\omega_i $$
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                \(L_o(x, \omega_o)\) is the outgoing light, from point \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\).
            </li>
            <li>
                \(L_e(x, \omega_o)\) is the emitted light, from point \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\).
            </li>
            <li>\(\Omega\) is the unit hemisphere centered along \(n\).</li>
            <li>\(n\) is the surface normal at point \(x\).</li>
            <li>\(\omega_i \in \Omega\) is a negated direction for possible incoming light.</li>
            <li>
                \(f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o)\) is the proportion of light, reflected from \(\omega_i\) toward
                \(\omega_o\), at position \(x\).
            </li>
            <li>
                \(L_i(x, \omega_i)\) is the incoming light, toward point \(x\), from direction \(\omega_i\).
            </li>
            <li>
                \(\omega_i \cdot n\) is the cosine of the angle between \(\omega_i\) and \(\n\). It is
                used as a weighting term and represents the fact that the intensity of reflected light from a surface is
                proportional to the cosine of the angle between the negated light direction and the surface normal. This
                is Lambert's cosine law.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This equation follows the same idea as the one presented above. It states that the amount of light
            going out of point \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\), is the sum of the light emitted by \(x\), along
            \(\omega_o\), and the reflected light at \(x\), along direction \(\omega_o\).
        </p>

        <p>
            Any rendering algorithm is trying to solve the rendering equation. More specifically, it is trying to find
            an approximate solution, that is good enough for its purposes.

        <h2>BRDF</h2>
        <p>
            Having discussed the rendering equation, we have already met the bidirectional reflectance
            distribution function, or BRDF for short. In the first form of the rendering equation, the BRDF is
            represented by function \( \rho(x, x', x'') \). In the second form of the rendering equation, the BRDF is
            represented by function \(f_r(x, \omega_i, \omega_o)\). We can see that, in both forms, the BRDF defines how
            light is reflected off a surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of the BRDF was first presented by Nicodemus, in 1965 <a href="#[2]">[2]</a>. The BRDF is defined
            as the ratio between reflected radiance along direction \(\omega_o\) and incoming irradiance, incident on
            surface point \(x\), coming from direction \(\omega_i\). For simplicity's sake, you can imagine the BRDF to
            be the ratio of outgoing and incoming light, the first along direction \(\omega_o\), the second along
            direction \(\omega_i\), at surface point \(x\).
