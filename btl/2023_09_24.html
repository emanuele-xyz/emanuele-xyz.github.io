    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented Phong lighting model: ambient + diffuse</li>
        <li>
            Use blender as rudimentary level editor
            <ul>
                <li>The scene you see has been made using blender</li>
                <li>I have written a simple exporter (python script) that takes a blender collection, considers it as a level and writes it to an xml file</li>
                <li>The exporter uses blender custom properties</li>
                <li>For now, the light and the camera have been hardcoded</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Implemented level abstraction as a hierarchy of game objects
            <ul>
                <li>Each game object has a set of components, such as: transform, model, point light, camera</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Implemented level loading from xml file</li>
        <li>
            Implemented scene system
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on a game object's components, the game object is handled differently by the scene system</li>
                <li>Game objects that have transform and model components are treated as simple lit scene objects</li>
                <li>Game objects that have transform and light components are treated as scene point lights. Only one is supported for now</li>
                <li>Game objects that have a camera component are treated as scene cameras. Only one camera is supported for now</li>
            </ul>
