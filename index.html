    <p>
        Hello, I'm Emanuele and I am a programmer by heart. 
        I strive to write code that is concise, easy to understand and modify, and that is also fast.
        I'm always eager and very happy to learn new things and I also like to challenge myself with hard problems.
        I strongly believe that programming is, not only a craft, but also a form of art.
        I also believe that great code makes great software and that great software makes people happy.
        For this reason, I always focus on writing the best code I can.
        Finally, I believe that no one can improve in their craft in isolation.
        Thus, I'm always very excited to talk and collaborate with other people.
    </p>
